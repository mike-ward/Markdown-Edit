Contributor Guidelines
======================

There are a number of ways to contribute:

-   Bug Reports: Yep, they happen and it's important catalog them for
    further investigation. Please use the Issues feature here in Github
    to report problems.
-   Language Translations: Check out the languages folder. It's only
    two files. You don't have to integrate it into the program unless
    you want to. You did the hard part of translating. I'm more than
    happy to incorporate the changes into the program.
-   Feature Requests: Got an idea for a feature. Open an issue. That way
    we can all see and comment on it.
-   Pull Requests: Use the `dev` branch.
-   Fix My Prose: Dammit Jim, I'm a programmer, not an English major.
-   Snippets, Templates, and Themes: Got a cool theme or some killer
    snippets? Send them to me. Better yet, open an issue and put them
    there so we can all see and comment on them.
-   Write a review (a nice one I hope)
