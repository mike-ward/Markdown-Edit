What's changed:

-   \#135 found some more edge cases and fixed
-   Add sprites as a DataUri to default template. External
    emojisprites.png no longer needed (but remains for legacy)
-   \#149 Add command line option to installer to suppress desktop
    icon (icon=0)
-   Fixed issue with external WpfMouseWheelLib crashing on some systems.
    Project appears to no longer be maintained. Created a Github project
    and fixed issue. Guess I own it now.
-   \#153 Added character encoding settings and automatic detection via
    Mozilla library.
-   Beefed up build commands.
