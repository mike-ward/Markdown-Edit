True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest."

 It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing:

 In the book it said: “Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without
chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the
six months that they need for digestion.”

I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some
work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my ﬁrst drawing. 
My Drawing Number One. It looked like this:

I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the
drawing frightened them.

But they answered: “Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a
hat?”

My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor
digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it,
I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa constrictor, so that the
grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained.
