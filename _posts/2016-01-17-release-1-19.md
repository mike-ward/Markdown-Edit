What's changed:

-   Multiline snippets: This makes writing/updating snippets that are
    several lines long easier. Example:
    
~~~

Simply add two semicolons after the snippet name, type your text and
then end the snippet with two semicolons (on a new line)

-   Format protector: I use markdown to write slides for presentations a
    I give. The slide package has some unusual front matter (not
    quite YAML) that MDE's format and wrap command messes up. Rather
    than build it in I add a special document command:

~~~
<!-- MDE -->
~~~

Anything above the marker does not get reformatted when using MDE's
formatting commands.

-   Updated to latest packages including the new release of MahApps
    which fixes some interface bugs.

-   Fix bugs #83, #84, #91, #92

-   Focus issues with preview resolved.

-   Preview Scroll Sync #89: Improved the syncing between text
    and preview. Note: **Improved**. It will never be perfect and can
    get fooled but should perform better than before. Without injecting
    text anchors into the source document, there's no way to do semantic
    syncing (at least none I can think of). I welcome any ideas on how
    to improve this.

There are a number of enhancements in the issues list. I haven't
forgotten them. Just wanted to get these bugs out of the way first.
