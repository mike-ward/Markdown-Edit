There's something hopeful and exciting about a blank page. The promise
of new journeys and of stories untold. And yet when I open a program
like Microsoft Word, I'm assaulted with menus and ribbons and decisions
about font size and colors and layouts. That's not for me. Content is
what I value. That's why I write in Markdown. And it's why I wrote
Markdown Edit.

Writing should first and foremost be about, well, writing. Presentation
matters but is in most cases it's an enhancement, not the message. Who
cares if your header is tall or short, fat or wide? That's the job of a
designer. The words, the content, the meaning, the flow and pace. That's
the writer's job.

And so I set out to write an editor that focused mainly on words. It
started out as a typical editor with a menu and status bars. But soon I
realized that these artifacts actually distracted from the writing
experience. And so little by little, I removed those elements that I
felt didn't directly contribute to the writing of words.

Perhaps the most controversial of these changes was removing the
traditional menu bar under the title bar. Common actions in many word
processing editors are the invoked in a similar manner. Can you think of
an editor that doesn't use `Ctrl+S` to save a document. `Ctrl+Z`,
`Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+X` and `Ctrl+V`? Granted, not everyone uses these
shortcuts but I didn't write MDE for everyone. I wrote MDE to work done
with less friction. That requires a bit of training on your part
although frankly, I don't think it's overly burdensome.

Other things I wanted.

-   It has to load fast. Performance is a feature.
-   Syntax highlighting should be accurate.
-   Handle large documents with ease.
-   Keep settings and configuration to a minimum.
-   Stupid simple installer.
-   Focus on doing Markdown well. Avoid non-Markdown stuff
    where practical.
-   And above all, make it PITA to use.

So there you have it. My attempt at a Markdown editor. Enjoy it or hate
it. I've had fun writing and using it and that's enough for me.
